      "question": "Which factor differentiates lost foam casting from investment casting? (LO3)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Use of foam instead of wax for the pattern",
        "b": "Need for bonded sand",
        "c": "Higher cost compared to investment casting",
        "d": "Use of permanent moulds"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Investment casting uses wax patterns, whereas lost foam casting uses polystyrene foam, which vaporises upon metal pouring.",
        "b": "Investment casting uses wax patterns, whereas lost foam casting uses polystyrene foam, which vaporises upon metal pouring.",
        "c": "Investment casting uses wax patterns, whereas lost foam casting uses polystyrene foam, which vaporises upon metal pouring.",

      "question": "Why is vibration necessary when using unbonded sand? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To remove impurities",
        "b": "To compact the sand and prevent defects",
        "c": "To accelerate the melting of metal",
        "d": "To remove air bubbles from the molten metal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Vibration densely packs the sand, ensuring uniform support around the foam pattern, reducing the chance of casting defects.",
        "b": "Vibration densely packs the sand, ensuring uniform support around the foam pattern, reducing the chance of casting defects.",
        "c": "Vibration densely packs the sand, ensuring uniform support around the foam pattern, reducing the chance of casting defects.",
        "d": "Vibration densely packs the sand, ensuring uniform support around the foam pattern, reducing the chance of casting defects."

  {
      "question": "Why does lost foam casting not require a parting line? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because the foam pattern is made in two halves",
        "b": "Because the pattern vaporises completely during casting",
        "c": "Because the sand mould is permanently bonded",
        "d": "Because the mould is reusable"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "In lost foam casting, the foam pattern is fully consumed by the molten metal, eliminating the need for a split mould or a parting line, which are typically required in traditional casting processes.",
        "b": "In lost foam casting, the foam pattern is fully consumed by the molten metal, eliminating the need for a split mould or a parting line, which are typically required in traditional casting processes.",
        "c": "In lost foam casting, the foam pattern is fully consumed by the molten metal, eliminating the need for a split mould or a parting line, which are typically required in traditional casting processes.",

      "question": "What role does the refractory coating play in lost foam casting? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It strengthens the foam pattern",
        "b": "It acts as a mould release agent",
        "c": "It prevents metal penetration into the sand",
        "d": "It speeds up the vaporisation of the foam"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The refractory coating creates a protective barrier that ensures the molten metal does not seep into the surrounding sand, improving the surface quality and accuracy of the final casting.",
        "b": "The refractory coating creates a protective barrier that ensures the molten metal does not seep into the surrounding sand, improving the surface quality and accuracy of the final casting.",
        "c": "The refractory coating creates a protective barrier that ensures the molten metal does not seep into the surrounding sand, improving the surface quality and accuracy of the final casting.",
        "d": "The refractory coating creates a protective barrier that ensures the molten metal does not seep into the surrounding sand, improving the surface quality and accuracy of the final casting."

 {
      "question": "What is one disadvantage of using unbonded sand in lost foam casting? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It requires additional binders to hold its shape",
        "b": "It is not reusable",
        "c": "It may shift if not properly compacted",
        "d": "It increases the casting temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Since unbonded sand is loose, it relies on vibration for compaction. If not properly compacted, the sand can shift during pouring, affecting the accuracy and surface quality of the casting.",
        "b": "Since unbonded sand is loose, it relies on vibration for compaction. If not properly compacted, the sand can shift during pouring, affecting the accuracy and surface quality of the casting.",
        "c": "Since unbonded sand is loose, it relies on vibration for compaction. If not properly compacted, the sand can shift during pouring, affecting the accuracy and surface quality of the casting.",
