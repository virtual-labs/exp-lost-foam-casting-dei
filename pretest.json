        "d": "Core sand"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Lost foam casting uses unbonded dry sand, which allows gas escape and compacts well around the foam pattern without requiring binders.",
        "b": "Lost foam casting uses unbonded dry sand, which allows gas escape and compacts well around the foam pattern without requiring binders.",
        "c": "Lost foam casting uses unbonded dry sand, which allows gas escape and compacts well around the foam pattern without requiring binders.",

      "question": "What material is used to coat the foam pattern in lost foam casting? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Wax",
        "b": "Ceramic",
        "c": "Permeable refractory slurry",
        "d": "Green sand"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The foam pattern is coated with a permeable refractory slurry, which, once dried, forms a rigid shell. This prevents metal penetration and improves the surface quality of the final casting.",
        "b": "The foam pattern is coated with a permeable refractory slurry, which, once dried, forms a rigid shell. This prevents metal penetration and improves the surface quality of the final casting.",
        "c": "The foam pattern is coated with a permeable refractory slurry, which, once dried, forms a rigid shell. This prevents metal penetration and improves the surface quality of the final casting.",

      "question": ". What happens to the foam pattern when molten metal is poured into the mould? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It melts and mixes with the metal",
        "b": "It expands and strengthens the mould",
        "c": "It vaporises completely, leaving a cavity for metal",
        "d": "It hardens to form the final shape"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The high temperature of molten metal causes the foam to vaporise, leaving an exact cavity that is then filled with metal, forming the final casting.",
        "b": "The high temperature of molten metal causes the foam to vaporise, leaving an exact cavity that is then filled with metal, forming the final casting.",
        "c": "The high temperature of molten metal causes the foam to vaporise, leaving an exact cavity that is then filled with metal, forming the final casting.",

      "question": "What is a major disadvantage of lost foam casting? (LO3)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High production speed",
        "b": "High pattern costs for low-volume production",
        "c": "Inability to cast large components",
        "d": "Limited material choices"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Since foam patterns are single-use, they are expensive for low production runs. If closed-die moulding is used for pattern creation, the initial tooling costs can also be high.",
        "b": "Since foam patterns are single-use, they are expensive for low production runs. If closed-die moulding is used for pattern creation, the initial tooling costs can also be high.",
